# Cars-Case-Study-Predictive-Modelling
The objective of the data is to predict whether or not an employee will commute to their offices with car or other modes of transportation based on employee’s personal and professional details like age, salary, work experience and as well as information about their current mode of transportation. In addition, we will also review the list of factors that plays significant roles in the predicting whether an employee will commute with cars or not. 

Project Objectives
•	To explore the data for a general and preliminary overview of the employees and their preferred means of transportations to work.
•	To prepare the data for analysis and illustrate the insights developed from the data analysis.
•	To highlight the most challenging aspect of the data analysis and discuss methods used to solve the problems.
•	To prepare the data for analysis. 
•	To create multiple models and explore how each model perform using appropriate model performance metrics. Some of the proposed models are;
o	KNN,
o	Naive Bayes (is it applicable here? comment and if it is not applicable, how can you build an NB model in this case?)
o	Logistic Regression.
•	To apply both bagging and boosting modeling procedures to create 2 models and compare its accuracy with the best model of the above step 
•	To summarize findings from the exercise in a concise yet actionable note.
